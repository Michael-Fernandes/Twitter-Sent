Yet another sentiment classifier for Twitter. The following project uses the python NLPTK library to create a naive-bayes classifier to categorize Tweets as positive or negative using a movie review feature set.

A prototype done for my final project in Interactive System Design(HCDE 310) in the Autumn of 2015.
